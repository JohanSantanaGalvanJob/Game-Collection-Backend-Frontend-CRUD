# Game Collection App

This is my own personal project on which I have developed a full-stack page using Spring and IONIC technologies.

## Pre-requisites

You may install Eclipse because it has a well preparated structure in order to perform your backend part. https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
It is also neccesary to instal MySQL workbench and the server itself and also create a database, put a table and introduce some information.
It is completely neccesary to install Node.js for the dependencies and the packages you will need in the frontend and backend part.
Visual Studio Code can be useful for your frontend part.

## Backend Part

Now you have Eclipse IDE. You may also install Spring. Once you have done it. You should make a project and separate the java classes in packages for a better controlling part. The Java classes are the controller, the model, some interfaces, , the skeleton where all the variables are going to be introduced, and the services. You have also to take in count the application.properties because we will need it in order to connecto to the databse
